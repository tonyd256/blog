        A wine education company focused on teaching people about wine through
        fun group experiences via subscription boxes. Together we built their
        beta MVP site focused on testing their core offering as well as
        gathering early adopter advocates. We focused on launchin a static
        website that would enhance SEO while giving them the power to make
        changes and manage beta user signups.
